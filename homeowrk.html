Susan Sontag talks about the history of photography and the evolution of why people use it. Its interesting how originally people started taking photos, it was to capture the vulnerability of a moment. Being able to take photos whenever we want has changed the purpose entirely. We use it to immortalize a moment to prove that we were there. Photography and Tourism have become linked. It shows that the event happened, a way of sharing the experience with others, and to capture a quick moment that would have otherwise been forgotten. It helps people feel like they have possession of the moment they are in, the past, and the space they are currently holding. Photography is made to cause emotion and document. It can also contribute to nostalgia and capture the aging of people. It helps connect people. Group photos show the closeness of the people in them. Photography has also become political. Photography had a big impact on the Vietnam War. When people saw certain pictures, it struck a nerve. It made people realize the severity of what was happening to everyday people like them. This shows how Carmreas can violate a moment. It can be used without consent or to push a certain narrative. Once it's taken, it can be used for other purposes that are outside the subject's control. The more we see photos throughout time, the more desensitised we become to them. A photo taken 100 years ago was too interesting because of the subject that's in it, whereas today it would be more interesting for the fact that it was taken 100 years ago.

Photos can also limit a moment by squeezing an entire experience into one photo. Since the photo is what's going to be immortalized past the person who took it, its native can change. It helps take a break from our constant work ethic. Using cameras helps people feel like they have a life outside of work. Photography has made its way into other hobbies. People in the safari now shoot photos of animals rather than shooting the animals. It seems like if we snapped a picture of something, it holds the idea that we know about the world that we captured. However, it all lies in the perspective. You can't capture everything in a photo, only what you want to be perceived in it. Social media proves this with people wanting to make everything attractive. We seek activities and places to capture the aesthetics of it, not because we want to prove we were there, but to prove we experienced something so beautiful it needs to be shared. It confirms our reality, but it becomes consuming. It disconnects us from our lives because we crave to consume, and taking photos becomes addictive. In this article, Sontag states that we take photos for immortalization of a moment, whether that be a family trip or a war, to have proof that we experience things outside of our nine-to-five, and lastly to satisfy a compulsion.
