<h2>Homework #1</h2>
</p>
<p>
Susan Sontag talks about the history of photography and the evolution of why people use it. Its interesting how originally people started taking photos, it was to capture the vulnerability of a moment. Being able to take photos whenever we want has changed the purpose entirely. We use it to immortalize a moment to prove that we were there. Photography and Tourism have become linked. It shows that the event happened, a way of sharing the experience with others, and to capture a quick moment that would have otherwise been forgotten. It helps people feel like they have possession of the moment they are in, the past, and the space they are currently holding. Photography is made to cause emotion and document. It can also contribute to nostalgia and capture the aging of people. It helps connect people. Group photos show the closeness of the people in them. Photography has also become political. Photography had a big impact on the Vietnam War. When people saw certain pictures, it struck a nerve. It made people realize the severity of what was happening to everyday people like them. This shows how Carmreas can violate a moment. It can be used without consent or to push a certain narrative. Once it's taken, it can be used for other purposes that are outside the subject's control. The more we see photos throughout time, the more desensitised we become to them. A photo taken 100 years ago was too interesting because of the subject that's in it, whereas today it would be more interesting for the fact that it was taken 100 years ago.

Photos can also limit a moment by squeezing an entire experience into one photo. Since the photo is what's going to be immortalized past the person who took it, its native can change. It helps take a break from our constant work ethic. Using cameras helps people feel like they have a life outside of work. Photography has made its way into other hobbies. People in the safari now shoot photos of animals rather than shooting the animals. It seems like if we snapped a picture of something, it holds the idea that we know about the world that we captured. However, it all lies in the perspective. You can't capture everything in a photo, only what you want to be perceived in it. Social media proves this with people wanting to make everything attractive. We seek activities and places to capture the aesthetics of it, not because we want to prove we were there, but to prove we experienced something so beautiful it needs to be shared. It confirms our reality, but it becomes consuming. It disconnects us from our lives because we crave to consume, and taking photos becomes addictive. In this article, Sontag states that we take photos for immortalization of a moment, whether that be a family trip or a war, to have proof that we experience things outside of our nine-to-five, and lastly to satisfy a compulsion.

<h2>Homework #2</h2>
</p>
<p>
Although AI is new, the information it feeds off of is very old. It scours the internet looking for information to absorb and push out quickly. This creates idealized content that feeds into racist, sexist, and homophobic structures. The images AI generates can create a world that feels artificial but “ideal” for certain users. Fascist groups use this to reinforce the idea of a perfect heteronormative family. Pumping out photos of white families where the women and men are conforming to old gender norms. This content can also be political, such as using AI to generate statements that politicians never said or to create political cartoons that comment on the current state of our world. Putting all this together, it creates what our everyday feed looks like, making it hard to differentiate what's real or fake. As a result, we often rely on the person posting or sharing the content to ensure its accuracy. This is where apps like WhatsApp have a larger negative effect on reliability. People are receiving AI-generated content from people in their circle. Since we trust the person who sent it and there is no chatroom to fact-check or argue otherwise, how can we tell it's not real? Since social media relies on interaction, and AI can generate content designed to provoke rapid engagement, it has taken over the internet by creating a space filled with robotic responses rather than genuine human interaction. Social media sites like Facebook further prove this cycle by prioritizing content that feeds off reactions and clicks, regardless of its authenticity. All this content farming is making us desensitized to real-world scenarios. The memes that we see about real-life events are making it so we don't have as big a reaction to react to it, but big enough to engage with the post and move on without giving thought to the severity or the statement made in the post, and how it's affecting us. This content mixed with real content makes it hard for us to differentiate what's real and fake.

Algorithms have a major role in trapping us inside these distorted realities. Social media is made to prioritize interaction, not the truth. AI-generated content does well in this environment because it is cheap to produce and fast to put out. It's easy to get emotional responses from people. As we interact with this content, platforms push more of it onto their feeds, reinforcing specific beliefs, aesthetics, and political narratives. This further separates people from a shared sense of reality. Ultimately, AI slop is proving that we can no longer trust the user who shared the post or what's on it. Instead, we have to learn how to be in the moment and analyze the situation. Without using fact-checking, what we are seeing and just scrolling to the next post, we are growing further from what is real and fake in media.  Making our algorithm give us anything we would accept. It's becoming more than a digital issue. It's becoming a societal one.
